== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use plugin filters =
Check out our [Snippet Library](https://github.com/codeinwp/Snippet-Library/).

= Cache Plugin Support =
WP Maintenance Mode can be unstable due to the cache plugins; we recommend deactivating any cache plugin when maintenance mode is active. If you **really** want to use a cache plugin, make sure you delete the entire cache after each change.

= Exclude list =
If you change your login url, please add the new slug (url: http://domain.com/newlogin, then you should add: newlogin) to Exclude list from plugin settings -> General Tab.

Notice: `wp-cron.php` is excluded by default.
